This code takes blast outformat 6, containing sequence IDs and the coordinates
for a blast hit. With this information and the location of the original fasta
files, the exact DNA sequence at these sites is then excised and saved as a 
separate file. 

Notably, this also allows for the extraction of the surrounding region of a BLAST hit. 
This buffer can be specified.

If a filename can not be found or is "." (an odd occurance, but it does happen), then the filename
is saved to a separate file and is saved as .err. 

If the extracted region extends past the total sequence length, the program will die.

INDEXING:

All coordinates are assumed to be fed to the program on index of 1
Coordinates will be adjusted to index 0 (subtraction of 1).
